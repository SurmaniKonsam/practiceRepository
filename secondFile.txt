hello secondFile hope you are doing good.
I am about to add you in your current branch that is rough branch okay.





have added space so will first push it from the roughBranch and merge into main of
remote repository

will checkout and then see into my local main whether its there or not

if not i will pull from my remote 

and again see.

they way my practice will be over.
