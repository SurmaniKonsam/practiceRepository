hello secondFile hope you are doing good.
I am about to add you in your current branch that is rough branch okay.





have added space so will first push it from the roughBranch and merge into main of
remote repository

will checkout and then see into my local main whether its there or not

if not i will pull from my remote + merge conflicts point 1 -> "also made changes here" 

and again see/merge conflict point 2 -> " made update to observe merge conflicts".

they way my practice will be over.


So, yes i was successfull in merging into main from remote 

checkout to my main and checked if the changes in the main from the remote is there or not

it was not

hence,
	i git pull the main from the remote.
	have already set upstream connection with the remote url
	then did -> git pull
	and,
	then after the changes was observed into my file.
